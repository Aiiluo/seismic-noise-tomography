Seismic noise tomography
========================
This project is dedicated to provide a Python framework for seismic noise tomography, 
based on [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) and numerical Python packages 
such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/).

Requirements
------------
The code is developped and tested on Ubuntu (but should run on other platforms as well)
with Python 2.7.

In addition to [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), you need
to install the following packages:

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) >= 1.8.2
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) >= 0.13.3
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) >= 1.3.1
- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki) >= 0.9.2
- [pyshp](https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp)
- [pyproj](https://code.google.com/p/pyproj/) >= 1.8.9
- [pyPdf](http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/)
